#Here's an explanation of each line of the code:
1.	import os: This line imports the os module, which provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
2.	log_directory = "/path/to/logs": This line defines a variable named log_directory that holds the path to the directory where the log files are located. Replace /path/to/logs with the actual path to your log directory.
3.	filtered_log_directory = "/path/to/filtered_logs": This line defines a variable named filtered_log_directory that holds the path to the directory where the filtered log files will be stored. Replace /path/to/filtered_logs with the actual path to your filtered log directory.
4.	for filename in os.listdir(log_directory):: This line starts a for loop that iterates over the list of filenames in the log_directory.
5.	if filename.endswith(".log"):: This line checks if the filename ends with .log, which means it is a log file.
6.	log_file = os.path.join(log_directory, filename): This line creates a variable log_file that holds the full path to the log file by combining the log_directory and the filename using the os.path.join function.
7.	filtered_log_file = os.path.join(filtered_log_directory, "filtered_" + filename): This line creates a variable filtered_log_file that holds the full path to the filtered log file by combining the filtered_log_directory and the filename with a prefix of "filtered_" using the os.path.join function.
8.	with open(log_file, "r") as file:: This line opens the log file in read mode and assigns the file object to a variable named file. The with statement ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside the with statement is completed.
9.	data = file.readlines(): This line reads all the lines of the log file and stores them in a list named data.
10.	filtered_data = []: This line creates an empty list named filtered_data.
11.	for line in data:: This line starts a for loop that iterates over the lines in the data list.
12.	if "org.apurba.ecom" in line:: This line checks if the string "org.apurba.ecom" is in the current line.
13.	filtered_data.append(line): If the string "org.apurba.ecom" is found in the line, this line appends the line to the filtered_data list.
14.	with open(filtered_log_file, "w") as file:: This line opens the filtered log file in write mode and assigns the file object to a variable named file. The with statement ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block of code inside the with statement is completed.
15.	`for line in filtered_data:
